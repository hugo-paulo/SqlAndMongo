The $lookup operator from the aggregation framework

nside the $lookup stage, we define the following:

accounts is the collection to join.
transfer_id as localField is the field to use in the equality match from the input documents.
transfers_complete as foreignField is the field to use in the equality match from the transfers collection.
account_id and account_holder are the projected fields in the resulting documents while suppressing the _id field.
account_holder is the name of the new array field to add to the input documents.
